    <h1>About Team Temperature</h1>
    <p>
      This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is,
      a happiness score.</p>
    <p>For the sake of security, very little information is stored or recorded.
      Each submitter is represented by a random ID, and a cookie is stored so
      really only to protect against accidental double submissions from the
      same user with the same browser.</p>
    <p>The results page are available to the creator using the same cookie
      mechanism, and also a password in case the cookie is lost.</p>

    <p>It is deployed at teamtempapp.herokuapp.com hosted on Heroku and the source can be examined
      <a href="https://github.com/rloomans/new-teamtemp">on Github</a>.
      All reasonable pull requests will be considered, as will any issues raised)</p>

    <p>The application is written in django against a postgresql database.</p>
