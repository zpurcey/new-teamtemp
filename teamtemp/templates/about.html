<h1>About Team Temperature</h1>
<p>
This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is, 
a happiness score.</p>
<p>For the sake of security, very little information is stored or recorded.
Each submitter is represented by a random ID, and a cookie is stored so 
really only to protect against accidental double submissions from the 
same user with the same browser.</p>
<p>The results page are available to the creator using the same cookie
mechanism, and also a password in case the cookie is lost.</p>

<p>It is deployed at teamtempapp.herokuapp.com hosted on Heroku and the source can be examined
<a href="https://github.com/zpurcey/new-teamtemp">on Github</a>.
All reasonable pull requests will be considered, as will any issues raised)</p>

<p>The application is written in django against a postgresql database.</p>
